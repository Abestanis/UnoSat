# Structure

This directory contains 3D files describing the different pieces of the UnoSat structure.
They can be viewed in a 3D Viewer and 3D printed.

To adapt the structure, it is recommended to use the public
[Onshape project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1b2584b2a54906835f609caf/w/062ec44c5d1d3febd62f15b8/e/112cbfbd77803ae6d864266e?renderMode=0&uiState=633e2055795656229abbbeb6).
There are variables that can change the dimensions of the structure without actually editing them.
