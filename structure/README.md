# Structure

This directory contains 3D files describing the different pieces of the UnoSat structure.
They can be viewed in a 3D Viewer and 3D printed.

The structure is designed to be extensible and easily adaptable.
Its outside dimensions are 90 mm by 74 mm by h, where h is the height that depends on the number and type of pieces
used. Because of this, the structure conforms to the CubeSat form factor and can create a 1 to n unit CubeSat.
The CubeSat format specifies that a 1 unit CubeSat must have a dimension of 10 by 10 by 10 centimeters.
Each additional CubeSat unit increases the allowed height of the structure by 10 centimeters.
The UnoSat structure is actually smaller than the specified 10 by 10 centimeters, which allows to add additional padding
and isolation material around the core structure and still fit inside the CubeSat form factor.
The UnoSat structure provides and inside payload area of 70 by 54 millimeters, which allows to fit an Arduino Uno and
any Arduino Uno compatible shield components.

The structure is based on the Lego system, which means that it has small cylindrical extrusions on the top
(which are called Lego heads), and holes on the bottom where the Lego heads can fit into.
It is in theory compatible with actual Lego pieces in terms of dimensions, but this has not been tested.
This was done to allow prototyping with Lego pieces rather than having to 3D print all pieces at the beginning.
The Lego approach allows to quickly adapt the structure to new requirements by rearranging pieces or adding new pieces
on top of old ones. As well as reusing so far unused already printed pieces for reasons of thrift,
reusability and sustainability.

To adapt the structure, it is recommended to use the public
[Onshape project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1b2584b2a54906835f609caf/w/062ec44c5d1d3febd62f15b8/e/112cbfbd77803ae6d864266e?renderMode=0&uiState=633e2055795656229abbbeb6).
There are variables that can change the dimensions of the structure without actually editing them.

## Pieces

The structure consists of individual 3D printable pieces, that can be stacked on top of each
other to create the structure. The different pieces are as follows:

| **Base** <br> The base piece is the bottom of the structure, but it can still be put on top of another piece. In that case, cables to connect to the Arduino below have to be put outside of the structure. It has an area to put an Arduino Uno. The base piece has an opening in the front to leave space for the Ethernet and power ports of the Arduino. Its inside structure is mapped precisely to the form of the Arduino Uno with a padding of 0.5mm, with structures to allow to fixate the PCB onto the structure. The outer dimensions of the base are 90mm by 74mm by 10mm, not including the Lego heads. | ![The 3D printed base structure part.](../images/Structure%20Base.jpg) ![The 3D printed Base structure part with an Arduino Uno.](../images/Structure%20Base%20with%20Arduino.jpg) |
